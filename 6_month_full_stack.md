**Take-away:** Every block below slots into this loop. If one is missing, the loop breaks.

## 1. Core Agent Hardware (Blocks 1-5)

| Block | Purpose in the stack | Hardware Budget* |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|
| **1 · SWARM INTEL** | 10 micro ISR drones/UGVs for reconnaissance & mapping | \$2.8 k – \$5.9 k |
| **2 · CRAWLERS** | 10 tracked bots for tight, ground-level sampling | \$1.6 k – \$3.8 k |
| **3 · JAMNET** | 1 micro drone that scans & protects RF spectrum | \$0.2 k – \$0.5 k |
| **4 · HIVE-MIND OPS** | Edge AI + comm hub that plans, logs, and re-flashes agents | \$0.7 k – \$1.45 k |
| **5 · FLYER (VTOL)** | 10 VTOL drones for vertical ingress & lift of sensors | \$3.3 k – \$6.1 k |

\*ranges = low ↔ high parts cost using exact specs on previous page.

## 2. Support & Safety Block (Block 6)

These **\$3–3.5 k** items close critical gaps:

| Theme | What it adds | Why prototype fails without it |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **Power / Docking** | Smart charger, fire-safe bags, Qi pads | Batteries charge safely & hands-free → continuous demos |
| **Time / Position** | UWB anchors, PPS GNSS clock | Synchronized logs → reproducible swarm behavior |
| **Comms Backbone** | Rugged mesh router, SDR sniffers | Stable bandwidth + RF sanity for JamNet tests |
| **Safety / Compliance** | Remote-ID beacons, big-red kill switch | Meets FAA + Newlab rules → no flight bans |
| **Tooling & Spares** | Rework iron, scope, fasteners, prop/motor kit | Field repairs in minutes, not days |
| **Data / DevOps** | 4 TB SSD, CI runner, cloud backup | No lost telemetry; firmware always consistent |
| **Human UX** | Rugged tablet + 200 Wh battery | One clean control screen investors can hold |

## 3. Money Map (6 Months)

| Bucket | \$ | Stack area unlocked |
|--------|---:|---------------------|
| Core Blocks 1-5 | ~15 000 | All air/ground agents + AI hub |
| Support Block 6 | ~3 500 | Power, safety, comms, tooling |
| Newlab & AAIR access (6 mo) | 8 000 | Always-on printers + GPS-denied cage |
| Insurance (COI + drone rider) | 3 000 | Legal flight & lab access |
| Founders living (2 × 2.5 k × 6) | 30 000 | Full-time focus, zero side gigs |
| Consumables / shipping | 3 000 | Props, resin, adhesives |
| Contingency buffer | 5 000 | Absorb price swings |
| **Total ask** | **≈ 72 000** |

## 4. 180-Day Execution Plan

| Month | Stack Progress | Demo Asset Produced |
|------:|----------------|---------------------|
| **1** | All parts + safety gear on-site; charger & battery SOP signed | Photo log of zero-state build |
| **2** | Frames printed; UWB anchors & mesh router live; bench tests pass | Bench video + PPS-synced logs |
| **3** | Indoor hover + crawler roll; kill-switch tested | 60 s “first lift” clip |
| **4** | GPS-denied nav flight (AAIR #1); Remote-ID broadcast verified | 2-bot mapping run video |
| **5** | Multi-bot sensor sweep; JamNet spectrum test; auto-dock pad working | 5-bot swarm timelapse |
| **6** | Full 10-bot mixed-domain mission; ROS bag + synced RF trace delivered | Investor demo reel + data pack |

**Result:** a **safe, clock-synced, self-charging swarm** demo in < 6 months.

## 5. Why This Budget Is “Full-Stack-Enough”

- **Vertical completeness**: agent → hive → UX → power → compliance → tooling.  
- **No fluff hires**: every dollar drives hardware or essential ops; founders do the work.  
- **Reg-ready**: Remote-ID + kill-switch means we can fly public demos tomorrow, not “Series A”.  
- **Immediate upside**: Qualifies for DIU \$50–500 k & SPARK \$100 k match in the same 6-mo window.
