# Drooid: palm-size swarms for modern battlefields  
Daniel Kalu & Fitz Doud ¬∑ July 2025

---

### **Slide 1: Problem**

**Modern battlefields demand scalable, intelligent, and expendable systems  but current robotics are:**

- Too large and expensive to deploy at scale
- Reliant on GPS and centralized control
- Vulnerable to jamming, destruction, or environmental limits
- Require too much operator input and training

> Result: Mission teams lack agile, intelligent assets for ISR, breaching, and multi-domain coordination in denied environments.

"75% of military casualties occur during reconnaissance and patrol missions" - DoD Combat Studies

### **Slide 2: Solution**

**Drooid builds insect-like teams of autonomous drones & crawlers that:**

- Think and coordinate like swarms  no single point of failure
- Operate in GPS- and comms-denied zones
- Are palm-sized, quiet, and rapidly manufacturable
- Perform recon, mesh networking, breaching, and perimeter defense

> **Think: "100 brains over one body" for modern tactical advantage.

### **Slide 3: Why Now?**

| Driver | 2025 Shift | Why It Matters |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Tactical Demand** | DoD shifting toward **attritable, scalable, multi-domain systems** | Projects like **Replicator, DIU, and AFWERX** fund swarm autonomy over single-drone platforms |
| **Geopolitical Catalyst** | Urban warzones like Ukraine & Gaza expose gaps in ISR and low-cost robotics | Need for saturation, redundancy, and GPS-denied autonomy is now mission-critical |
| **AI-on-Edge Breakthrough** | Jetson Orin Nano & RK3588 **< $100** | Autonomous decisions now made **onboard**, not in the cloud ‚Äî immune to jamming |
| **Micro-flight Maturity** | MEMS, lightweight batteries, and silent actuators reach swarm viability | Palm-size bots now fly **15+ minutes** and carry real payloads |
| **AI-to-Print Loop** | Additive tools + AI CAD pipelines collapse design cycles | We go from prompt to prototype in **< 72 hours** using Newlab Detroit facilities |
| **Newlab Advantage** | Access to $500k+ of tools: drone cage, mSLA printers, motion lab | Full-stack prototyping without capital expense |

> ‚úÖ The tech stack, military demand, and prototyping infrastructure are finally aligned ‚Äî **now is the time to swarm.**

### **Slide 4: Product Overview ‚Äì Drooid Swarm Kit**

Drooid delivers modular swarms of nano-robots for hard physical jobs.

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Aerial Units** | Palm-sized ornithopter drones designed for ISR, mapping, gas detection, and perimeter sweeps |
| **Ground Crawlers** | Compact wheeled or legged bots for rubble traversal, indoor sensing, breaching, and scouting |
| **Aquatic Swimmers** | Silent, fish-like bots for flooded tunnels, storm drains, and marine sensing |
| **Payload Modules** | Plug-and-play: HD cameras, IR, gas sensors, breaching tips, comms relays, beacons |

üì¶ **Starter Kit**: 10 aerial drones + 10 crawlers with mission-configurable payloads. All units pack into a field-deployable swarm case.

> **Mission-ready in minutes. Backpack-portable. Task-specialized.**

| **Swarm Hardware** | Lightweight, modular bots that fly, crawl, and swim ‚Äî engineered for speed, scale, and survivability |
| **Swarm OS** | Decentralized autonomy layer that enables fault-tolerant, GPS-free mission execution |
| **Mesh Comms** | Peer-to-peer swarm network for resilient operation in comms-denied zones |
| **AI-to-Print Pipeline** | GPT-CAD design ‚Üí 3D print ‚Üí field bench in <72 hours ‚Äî ultra-fast form factor iteration |
| **Constructor Feasibility Engine** | Filters out physically impossible tasks using counterfactual logic before missions launch |
| **Hive Box** | Wearable field base that handles swarm computation, telemetry, and relay |
| **Book of Nature** | Living database of swarm outcomes that improves task success with every mission run |

> **From idea to swarm deployment in a week. Each layer is built for real-world failure and recovery.**
