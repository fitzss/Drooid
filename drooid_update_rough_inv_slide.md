# Drooid: palm-size swarms for modern battlefields  
Daniel Kalu & Fitz Doud · July 2025

---

### **Slide 1: Problem**

**Modern battlefields demand scalable, intelligent, and expendable systems  but current robotics are:**

- Too large and expensive to deploy at scale
- Reliant on GPS and centralized control
- Vulnerable to jamming, destruction, or environmental limits
- Require too much operator input and training

> Result: Mission teams lack agile, intelligent assets for ISR, breaching, and multi-domain coordination in denied environments.

"75% of military casualties occur during reconnaissance and patrol missions" - DoD Combat Studies

---

### **Slide 2: Solution**

**Drooid builds insect-like teams of autonomous drones & crawlers that:**

- Think and coordinate like swarms  no single point of failure
- Operate in GPS- and comms-denied zones
- Are palm-sized, quiet, and rapidly manufacturable
- Perform recon, mesh networking, breaching, and perimeter defense

> **Think: "100 brains over one body" for modern tactical advantage.

### **Slide 3 · Why Now?**

- **DoD is buying swarms now**  
  Replicator, DIU sUAS, and AFWERX TACFI all fund low-cost, attritable autonomy.  

- **Edge-AI + batteries finally fit in a palm**  
  Jetson Orin Nano / RK3588 boards **< $100** + 350 Wh/kg cells ⇒ 15 min endurance with on-board inference.  

- **GPS-denied wars expose the gap**  
  Ukraine, Gaza, and looming Indo-Pac flashpoints show the cost of losing ISR and comms.  

- **Prototype loop is instant**  
  Newlab Detroit’s printers, drone cage, and motion-lab let us go **prompt → flight test in < 72 h** with zero cap-ex.

### **Slide 4: Product Overview – Drooid Swarm Kit**

Drooid delivers modular swarms of nano-robots for hard physical jobs.

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Aerial Units** | Palm-sized ornithopter drones designed for ISR, mapping, gas detection, and perimeter sweeps |
| **Ground Crawlers** | Compact wheeled or legged bots for rubble traversal, indoor sensing, breaching, and scouting |
| **Aquatic Swimmers** | Silent, fish-like bots for flooded tunnels, storm drains, and marine sensing |
| **Payload Modules** | Plug-and-play: HD cameras, IR, gas sensors, breaching tips, comms relays, beacons |

📦 **Starter Kit**: 10 aerial drones + 10 crawlers with mission-configurable payloads. All units pack into a field-deployable swarm case.

> **Mission-ready in minutes. Backpack-portable. Task-specialized.**

### **Slide 5 · Core Tech Stack (Prototype v0)**

| Pillar            | Ships in the first 6 months                            | Why it matters                                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Nano-Bots**     | 10 flyers + 10 crawlers, printed frames, COTS sensors  | Cheap, expendable, backpack-deployable           |
| **SwarmOS Lite**  | Decentralized nav, mesh comms, hard kill-switch        | Keeps running when GPS or radio is jammed        |
| **HiveBox**       | Laptop-size field base: compute, charger, data logger  | One plug-in hub powers & coordinates the swarm   |
| **AI-to-Print**   | Prompt → CAD → 3-D print in **48 h**                   | Hardware iterations move at software speed       |

> **Focus:** prove this minimal full stack first—then add swimmers, advanced payloads, and the Constructor engine after Series A.

### Slide 6 · Biomimetic Swarm Designs

Field-ready forms inspired by nature.  
Each unit built from COTS parts and rapid printing.

- **Dragonfly** flyer – indoor or outdoor recon  
- **Fish** swimmer – flooded tunnel and drain mapping  
- **Orb** comm ball – drops in rubble to relay voice and data

All designs are backpack-deployable and task-specific.

---

### Slide 7 · Example Class · Dragonfly Flyer

**Use cases**  
search and rescue, gas-leak scouting, bridge and roof inspection

**Key features**  
VTOL, ducted fans for safety, hover imaging, forward sweep mode

*Example mission* — map a GPS-denied high-rise after shelling to locate survivors and toxic pockets.

---

### Slide 8 · DoD Applications

**Special Operations** – silent advance recon, perimeter sensors  
**FOB Security** – twenty-four seven autonomous fence patrol  
**Urban Warfare** – room-by-room intel and IED spotting  
**Border & Area Denial** – persistent watch with minimal logistics

Drooid scales from platoon kits to base-wide mesh nets.

### Slide 9 · Operational Advantages

| Advantage | Impact |
| --------- | ------ |
| **Redundant swarm** | Mission survives individual losses |
| **Low unit cost** | Affordable mass and attrition use |
| **Adaptive AI** | Replans locally when jammed |
| **Tiny footprint** | Hard to detect and target |
