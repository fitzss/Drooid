# The Constructor Tile

## What is it?
A tiny chip (about the size of your fingernail) that turns heat into electricity—**without a battery.**

## What does it do?
Imagine a chip that:
- **Collects a little heat** from your body, sunlight, or a warm pipe
- **Stores that heat energy**
- **Uses it to power something small**—like a sensor or a tiny robot

## How does it work (simply)?
It has **three thermal “states”**—hot, medium, and cold.

Every time it moves between these states, it **generates a little bit of electricity.**  
It treats heat as **a source of work,** just like a steam engine does—only *microscopic*.

## Why is this useful?
Right now, most tiny devices—like wearables or sensors—**need batteries.**

But batteries:
- Run out
- Can’t always be recharged
- Add weight and cost
- Are hard to replace in large numbers

**The Constructor Tile** powers devices **from the heat around them**—**no battery needed.**

## Who would use this?
- **Disaster response teams**: To send in swarms of small robots that don’t need recharging
- **Hospitals**: To monitor patients with smart patches that don’t require batteries
- **Shipping companies**: To track packages through hot/cold environments—using just heat

## What problem does it solve?
It solves the **power problem for tiny autonomous devices**.  
Right now, companies can’t easily scale these devices because **they can’t power them cheaply, reliably, or sustainably.**

## Why it’s possible now:
- Small thermoelectric generators already exist
- BLE chips use ultra-low power
- Wearables and swarm bots are growing markets
- Constructor Theory gives a **new lens** for how to define work and power—letting you design smarter

## Bottom line (in plain terms):
This prototype turns **waste heat** into **real work**.  
It gives power to small devices **in places where batteries just don’t work.**

And by focusing on **how energy flows between “states”**—hot, warm, cold—you’re applying physics in a way that’s **useful, efficient, and visionary.**
