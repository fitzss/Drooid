| **A – Working 3-bot swarm prototype**<br>*Flyer, crawler, swimmer cooperate for a simple SAR or inspection task*       | **Very high** – video of a live swarm in a real place sells the vision; SAR demand is in the news after every quake/fire ([Aeronautics][1]) | Moderate – you already specced the BOM; main unknowns are tuning and comms noise                             | Needs a basic Hive Box and an open-source vision model (YOLOv8-nano) for object detection; AI-to-Print loop is nice-to-have, not blocker | 4–6 weeks to demo-ready          | **Do this first**. Nothing beats “it already works” footage when raising pre-seed.                                            |
| **B – AI-to-Print loop fully automated**<br>*Parametric CAD → optimiser → slicer → printer → QC*                       | Medium – investors like internal “moat tech,” but it’s invisible without hardware that matters                                              | High – automation glue, calibration data, failure handling; easier after you know what parts you’re printing | Needs at least one proven frame geometry; printers and OctoPrint farm in place                                                           | 6–8 weeks for first closed loop  | **Parallel background task**. Treat as internal efficiency R\&D that converts any new design request into hardware overnight. |
| **C – Edge foundation-model autonomy**<br>*LLM/VLM running on Jetson for natural-language tasking & scene description* | Low-to-medium today – wow factor, but many startups claim “AI edge.” Buyers first ask: “Can it survive the rubble?”                         | High – model compression, on-device latency, reliability                                                     | Needs stable power budget, final sensor stack                                                                                            | 8–12 weeks plus tuning           | **Defer** until after the swarm can drive/fly/crawl on its own. A thin YOLO detector is enough for a pilot.                   |
| **D – Full Constructor-Theory feasibility engine**<br>*Physics-based “can/can’t” planner + API*                        | Strategic, but abstract. Most customers won’t pay until they trust the hardware.                                                            | Very high – original research & formalisation                                                                | Needs real task data from multiple field runs                                                                                            | 3–6 months before credible alpha | **Explore on paper, keep on the road-map**. Log real-world constraints during swarm pilots to seed the knowledge base.        |

Recommended sequencing
Weeks 0-6 – “Visible hardware first”
Goal: three nano-drones completing a scripted search-and-report demo in the Newlab outdoor corridor.
Why: It shows exact market use (SAR / inspection) and uses Newlab’s mobility pedigree to attract early customers and Detroit-area investors. Michigan Central’s BeaconLab is built precisely to accelerate concept-to-field prototypes

SBN Detroit
.

Weeks 3-8 – Silent build-automation sprint in the background
Goal: nightly AI-to-Print loop that can spit out replacement arms or new sensor mounts without human babysitting.
Why: Cuts iteration cost and becomes a talking point once the swarm demo exists: “We improved this frame three times in five days.”

Weeks 7-12 – “Brains catch up”
Plug-in a Tiny-YOLO or Mobile-SAM model on the Jetson Orin. Prove edge inference doesn’t kill battery life. This rounds out the demo: tiny bots autonomously map or highlight hazards.

Quarter 2 – Feasibility engine research + pilot customer
Use data from demo missions (power draw, thrust margins, sensor noise) to train the first rules in the Constructor-Theory knowledge base. Pitch a pilot to city fire/rescue or a utilities inspection group while raising Seed.

Why investors and customers respond better to Milestone A first
Tangible risk reduction. A real swarm that flies/crawls/swims shows you can handle navigation, comms, weight, and reliability – the biggest doubts for nano-scale robots.

Market pull is urgent. Post-disaster SAR robotics is cited by defence and civil agencies worldwide; new swarm counter-UAS efforts only raise the profile

Detroit ecosystem fit. Newlab already houses mobility hardware startups and press routinely covers “first demo” moments

Execute with a “vertical slice” mindset
Swarm demo scope:

3 × bots carry a 5 g CO₂ sensor and camera.

Objective: locate a simulated gas leak marker within 90 s, relay GPS/UWB position to Hive.

Success metrics: 70 % mission completion, < 50 ms comms latency, < 2 % packet loss.

Hive Box V0: Raspberry Pi 5 + UWB anchors + DDS relay running finite-state mission script. Feasibility engine stub simply checks battery voltage ≥ safe min.

AI-to-Print loop v0.5: Manual “approve” step before slice-to-print; fully automatic QC can wait.

Deliver the vertical slice first, then widen horizontally (automation, edge AI, theory). That order maximises visible progress while you quietly build the moat underneath.
