| **A – Working 3-bot swarm prototype**<br>*Flyer, crawler, swimmer cooperate for a simple SAR or inspection task*       | **Very high** – video of a live swarm in a real place sells the vision; SAR demand is in the news after every quake/fire ([Aeronautics][1]) | Moderate – you already specced the BOM; main unknowns are tuning and comms noise                             | Needs a basic Hive Box and an open-source vision model (YOLOv8-nano) for object detection; AI-to-Print loop is nice-to-have, not blocker | 4–6 weeks to demo-ready          | **Do this first**. Nothing beats “it already works” footage when raising pre-seed.                                            |
| **B – AI-to-Print loop fully automated**<br>*Parametric CAD → optimiser → slicer → printer → QC*                       | Medium – investors like internal “moat tech,” but it’s invisible without hardware that matters                                              | High – automation glue, calibration data, failure handling; easier after you know what parts you’re printing | Needs at least one proven frame geometry; printers and OctoPrint farm in place                                                           | 6–8 weeks for first closed loop  | **Parallel background task**. Treat as internal efficiency R\&D that converts any new design request into hardware overnight. |
| **C – Edge foundation-model autonomy**<br>*LLM/VLM running on Jetson for natural-language tasking & scene description* | Low-to-medium today – wow factor, but many startups claim “AI edge.” Buyers first ask: “Can it survive the rubble?”                         | High – model compression, on-device latency, reliability                                                     | Needs stable power budget, final sensor stack                                                                                            | 8–12 weeks plus tuning           | **Defer** until after the swarm can drive/fly/crawl on its own. A thin YOLO detector is enough for a pilot.                   |
| **D – Full Constructor-Theory feasibility engine**<br>*Physics-based “can/can’t” planner + API*                        | Strategic, but abstract. Most customers won’t pay until they trust the hardware.                                                            | Very high – original research & formalisation                                                                | Needs real task data from multiple field runs                                                                                            | 3–6 months before credible alpha | **Explore on paper, keep on the road-map**. Log real-world constraints during swarm pilots to seed the knowledge base.        |
