# Use of Funds – $500k SAFE Raise (Drooid)

## Overview
This budget reflects a lean, early-stage build-focused team. Funds are not allocated to full salaries but to enable 12+ months of high-leverage prototyping, testing, and milestone delivery.

|--------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Builder Stipends (4 builders, ~12mo)** | $120k      | $2.5k/month avg. per person—enough to live and build without full salary     |
| **Prototyping + BOM Materials**       | $100k      | Covers parts for ~20 swarm bots, sensors, Hive Box v2, rebuilds, spares      |

| **Strategic Hires (contract/fellowships)** | $40k       | Short-term AI/simulation expert, or mechanical CAD support                   |
| **Travel + Mission Demo (VCs, partners)** | $40k       | DC, Detroit, grant meetings, gov demos, pilot site visits                    |
| **Legal, Setup, Ops**                 | $20k       | SAFE admin, IP filing, basic incorporation + compliance                      |
| **Runway Buffer**                     | $120k      | 5–6 months burn extension if grants delayed or hardware iteration needed     |

## Summary Tagline
> “This is not a $500k pitch to finish an idea. It’s a $500k sprint: proving a new class of robotics is ready for the field and built for scale.”
