**Slack DM / Internal Memo to Daniel – “Stitching the Edgar Opportunity Into Our Pitch”**
---

### 0. TL;DR
Edgar isn’t just another angel; he is a three-in-one accelerant:  
1) **Insurance gate-opener** who can clear Newlab’s COI hurdle in days,  
2) **Defense-sector sherpa** with warm paths to our first mission-grade pilots, and  
3) **Credible lead cheque** that signals operational discipline to other investors.  
Our pitch should present his role as a lever that compresses *time-to-prototype*, *time-to-pilot*, and *time-to-raise*—all while giving him a piece of a highly defensible stack at the cheapest valuation he’ll ever see.

### 1. Why Edgar Is the Perfect Fit (and How We Spell It Out)

| Pain Point on Our Critical Path | Edgar’s Specific Super-Power | How We Phrase the Ask |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **COI + drone rider by 15 July** | Principal at EPIC Insurance; writes A&D GL policies weekly | “Bind a $1 M/$2 M policy, list New Lab LLC + MCID, and negotiate drone coverage so we’re in the shop on Day 1.” |
| **Liability / ITAR clauses for August demos** | Insurance lawyer for defense OEMs | “Adapt your proven clauses for sub-150 g swarms so FEMA & AFRL teams sign without red-lines.” |
| **Pilot intros that matter** | Portfolio of 8 defense-tech startups, contacts at UN OCHA & AFRL | “Two warm intros after the prototype flies—one civil (OCHA) and one DoD (AFRL RS Lab).” |
| **Anchor for $500 k SAFE** | Active seed investor; understands risk vs. upside | “Lead or co-lead $250–500 k at $6 M post, with pro-rata and MFN info rights.” |

### 2. Narrative Arc for the Call / Deck

1. **Problem (30 sec)**  
   *First responders still crawl through rubble blind, firefighters blow thousands on heavy ROVs that flip, and DoD wants indoor swarms yesterday.*

2. **Solution (45 sec)**  
   *AI-generated, 3-D-printed insect drones—the Dragonfly (air), Fish (water), Orb (relay)—all controlled by a backpack LLM edge hub.*

3. **Why Now (30 sec)**  
   *AAIR waiver zone just opened; DoD FY-25 UAS budget +42 %. Specialty drone-swarm insurance products launched Q1. Newlab Detroit puts $500 k of printers at our fingertips.*

4. **Execution Plan (60 sec)**  
   *July–Aug sprint → indoor hover, pipe swim, 5-bot Detroit tower demo. Grants in flight. Seed round stretches run-way 12 mo.*

5. **“This Is Where You Come In” (2 min)**  
   *Spell out Edgar’s four plays (policy, legal language, pilots, cheque). Emphasise that each unlocks a gating item on our Gantt chart—*he* compresses the schedule.*

6. **Deal Terms (30 sec)**  
   *$500 k SAFE @ $6 M post; lead slot open. Close by 31 Aug to capitalise on demo press.*

7. **Close (15 sec)**  
   *“If the dual role—risk-advisor + lead investor—feels right, we’ll send the SAFE and draft COI tonight and see you in Detroit for the tower run.”*

### 3. Materials We Need Pre-Call

| Asset | Owner | Status / To-Do |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **One-pager** (Drooid × Edgar sheet v3) | Fitz | Final in GDrive |
| **SAFE draft** | Daniel | Duplicate YC post-money SAFE; add MFN info rights placeholder |
| **Sample COI PDF** | Fitz | Already in inbox—pull into data room |
| **Milestone Gantt** (visual) | Daniel | Export from Notion timeline, mark Edgar-dependent tasks in orange |
| **10-slide mini-deck** | Fitz | Finish by EOD tomorrow (include Newlab photos + FAA corridor map) |
| **Data-room folder** | Daniel | CAD, flight logs, HiveBox bill-of-materials spreadsheet |

---

### 4. Suggested Call Agenda (30 min)

1. **Rapport (3 min)** – Daniel recaps how Edgar helped with his school docs.  
2. **Vision & Demo Plan (5 min)** – Fitz walks through deck slides 1-5.  
3. **Risk & Insurance Deep Dive (7 min)** – Hand floor to Edgar, invite his perspective.  
4. **Deal Mechanics (5 min)** – SAFE terms, tranche timing, rights.  
5. **Pilot & Network Synergy (5 min)** – Discuss AFRL / OCHA opportunities.  
6. **Next Steps & Commitments (5 min)** – COI quote timeline, SAFE red-line schedule, August demo save-the-date.

### 5. Key Talking Points / Rebuttals

* **“Why sub-250 g bio-mimetic instead of rugged DJI Matrice?”**  
  *Sub-250 g dodges indoor waiver overhead, reduces kinetic energy risk → better insurance premiums → faster municipal approvals.*

* **“Won’t DJI just do this?”**  
  *DJI’s model relies on high-margin hardware; they don’t cannibalise with $50 printable frames, nor do they pass ITAR.*  

* **“How do you reach BOM <$400 at 100 units?”**  
  *Show spreadsheet: resin + COTS STM32 ESC + 2S Li-ion = $55 airframe; HiveBox components bulk-priced at $110.*

* **“What if an Orb relay fails mid-mission?”**  
  *Constructor-theory feasibility filter rejects comms-critical tasks if mesh redundancy < N; we show simulation logs.*

### 6. Risks We Should Proactively Surface

| Category | Mitigation we mention |
|----------|-----------------------|
| **Regulatory shift** | Edge-only flight mode (no cloud) keeps us ITAR-compliant; Edgar’s legal oversight. |
| **Battery fire** | Sub-1 Ah Li-ion packs + COI coverage + drone-cage tests; spec fire-retardant resin option. |
| **Funding gap** | $744 k of non-dilutive grants in pipeline; Edgar’s lead check reduces dilution while grants land. |

### 7. Immediate Actions for You, Daniel

1. **Populate data-room folder** – CAD, HiveBox BoM, legal docs template.  
2. **SAFE draft & cap-table snapshot** – have it ready for same-day send.  
3. **Gantt export** – visual of milestones with Edgar dependencies.  
4. **Dry-run Q&A** – tomorrow 4 pm; we role-play tough insurance questions.

If we nail the narrative—that Edgar’s superpower is *time-compression*—the value proposition is self-evident: he lowers risk, speeds revenue, and gets a front-row seat in a category the DoD is actively subsidising. Let’s sync tomorrow after you’ve punched out the SAFE and the Gantt, then lock the deck.
